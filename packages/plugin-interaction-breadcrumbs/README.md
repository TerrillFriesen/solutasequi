# @bugsnag/plugin-interaction-breadcrumbs

This plugin adds the ability to record click events as breadcrumbs by listening to events on the `window`, with the selector and text of the target element (if available) added to the breadcrumb as metadata. It defines a configuration option `interactionBreadcrumbsEnabled` which can be used to disable the functionality. It is included in the browser notifier.
