# @bugsnag/plugin-navigation-breadcrumbs

This plugin adds the ability to record browser navigation as breadcrumbs by listening to events on the `window` and monkey-patching `pushState`/`replaceState` history methods. It defines a configuration option `navigationBreadcrumbsEnabled` which can be used to disable the functionality. It is included in the browser notifier.
